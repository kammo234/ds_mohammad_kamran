# ds_Mohammad_Kamran

This repo follows the **required submission structure**. Open and run the notebooks in **Google Colab**.

## Structure
```
ds_Mohammad_Kamran/
├── notebook_1.ipynb      # Data load/clean/EDA + join trades with sentiment
├── notebook_2.ipynb      # Modeling (logit/RF), tests, clustering, event study
├── csv_files/            # All CSV inputs/outputs (merged, KPIs, clusters, etc.)
├── outputs/              # Saved figures
├── ds_report.pdf         # (Export your report into this path from the template)
└── README.md
```

## Quickstart (Colab)
1. Upload the entire folder to a GitHub repo.
2. Open `notebook_1.ipynb` in Colab.
3. Ensure Google Drive links are publicly viewable. The notebook uses `gdown` with these IDs:
   - Hyperliquid: `1IAfLZwu6rJzyWKgBToqwSmmVYU6VbjVs`
   - Fear & Greed: `1PgQC0tO8XN-wqkNyghWc_-mnrYv_nhSf`
4. Run all cells — it will save merged data and KPIs to `csv_files/` and charts to `outputs/`.
5. Open `notebook_2.ipynb` for modeling, clustering, and event study.
6. Write up findings in `ds_report_template.md`, then export to **PDF** as `ds_report.pdf`.
